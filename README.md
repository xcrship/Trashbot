# Trashbot


Trashbot will be a 2D platformer/Sim game that follows trashbot, a robot sent to Terra to collect resources left over from the humans that once lived there. 
It allows you to buy, sell, and collect scrap, traces, and cosmetics, and explore the planet in unlockable portions. 

Stick around :)
